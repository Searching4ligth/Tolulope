100 Days of Code. As a beginner Phytonnista. 
Question one. Area of a circle can simply be evaluated using following formula. Area = pi * r^2 where r is radius of circle. use PI = 3.142 and write a program that will prompt the user to enter the radius, then output the calculated area.

Question two. Write a simple python program that ask a user for length and with of rectangle and calculate the area of that rectangle. 

Question three. Write a simple python program that ask a use for the length of a square and calculates it's area.


Question four:
Write a python program that ask for the user to enter a shape (circle, square or rectangle)
if the user enter's square, calculate  ask for the side and calculate the area
if the user enters rectangle, ask for the length and width and calculate the area
if the user enters circle, ask for the radius and  calculate the area
(Note you can use your codes from questions' one, two and three).
